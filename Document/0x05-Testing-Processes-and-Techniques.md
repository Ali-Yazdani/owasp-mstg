Black box test a kind of blind test because you don't have information from target. For example:
you don't have information about application, server and API.

## White-box Testing
In white box testing unlike black box testing most focus on the code review. Tester try to analyze code and extract vulnerability form code. Tseter use decomplier and code analyzer to detect and assessment vulnerabilities.
